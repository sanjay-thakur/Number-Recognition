# Handwritten Digit Recognition Project

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model is trained to accurately predict the digits in images of handwritten numbers.

## Features

- Trained a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras on the MNIST dataset.
- Achieved [mention your model's accuracy] accuracy on the test set.
- Implemented a user-friendly GUI for scanning and predicting handwritten digit images.
- Integrated image preprocessing and prediction functionalities.
- Included a trained model (`model_Gau.h5`) that can be used for predictions.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run the provided Python script `handwritten_digit_recognition.py` to open the GUI.
3. Click the "Open Image" button to load a handwritten digit image.
4. The model will predict the digit in the image and display the result.
5. Experiment with your own handwritten digit images and see how the model performs!
